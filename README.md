# coronavirus-sf

Charts to understand coronavirus trends & growth rates in SF and nearby counties.

See site at https://coronavirus-sf.now.sh.

This is a public service project by [@xianke](https://www.twitter.com/xianke), launched on March 14, 2020.

Automatic data generation for SF, Santa Clara, and Bay Area totals by [@btogzhan2000](https://github.com/btogzhan2000), and is in use as of August 14, 2020.


# why does this site exist?

I wanted to know more about the virus growth rate in my local area (SF), but could not clearly see the historical and growth data anywhere on the Internet. So I started tracking it myself by sending myself emails with the daily data shown at https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus.asp (as of March 10, 2020).

Then I decided to put the info on charts within a share-able web page (https://coronavirus-sf.now.sh) -- so that others could easily see this data also.

Based on user feedback, I'm tracking a few more counties in the SF Bay Area.

# how about other counties? 

On April 12, 2020, I launched http://covid-usa.groveflow.com/ based on an aggregated data source that has stats for all 3000+ USA counties. 

On July 4, 2020, additional charts and analyses launched with data generation and help from [@btogzhan2000](https://github.com/btogzhan2000).


# how's the data quality?

Data sources for coronavirus stats are often inconsistent. Gathering high-quality data is harder than it sounds.

The goal has been to make https://coronavirus-sf.now.sh show the highest-quality data available. Automation also became an important goal as the pandemic passed the 5-month mark. As of August 14, 2020, the site's pages for San Francisco and Santa Clara counties use customly-generated data that are automatically processed from the highest-quality data available.
