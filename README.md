# coronavirus-sf

Charts to understand coronavirus growth rate in SF and nearby counties.

See site at https://coronavirus-sf.now.sh.


# why does this site exist?

I wanted to know more about the virus growth rate in my local area (SF), but could not clearly see the historical and growth data anywhere on the Internet. So I started tracking it myself by sending myself emails with the daily data shown at https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus.asp. 

Then I decided to put the info on charts within a share-able web page (https://coronavirus-sf.now.sh) -- so that others could easily see this data also.

Based on user feedback, I'm tracking a few more counties in the SF Bay Area.

Feel free to fork this Github repository and set up your own page. Just let me know if you're doing this. Attribution is appreciated. I will also add your page to this readme!
